-Copyright FAQ
-=============
-
-   1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?
-
-      Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
-      competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
-      and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
-      from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
-      do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
-      however.
-
-   2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
-      sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?
-
-      Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a &quot;larger software package&quot; to begin 
-      with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
-      See 1. above.
-
-   3. Are derivative works allowed?
-      Yes!
-
-   4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
-      Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).
-
-   5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?
-
-      You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
-      quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
-      ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
-      names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
-      substitutions could still could have occurred during font
-      opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
-      copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!
-
-   6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
-       adopted in future versions?
-
-      Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
-      provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
-      the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
-      additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
-      entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
-      both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
-      glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
-      design. Vera cannot become a &quot;ransom note&quot; font. Jim Lyles will be
-      providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
-      guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.
-
-   7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?
-
-      Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
-      with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.
-
-   8. If applications have built the names &quot;Bitstream Vera&quot; into them, 
-      can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?
-
-      This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
-      systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
-      use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
-      selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
-      names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
-      supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
-      &quot;sans&quot;, &quot;serif&quot; and &quot;monospace&quot;.  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
-      core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.
