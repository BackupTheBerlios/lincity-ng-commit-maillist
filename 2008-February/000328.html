-	&lt;p style=&quot;hp&quot;&gt;Health centres are very expensive, 60,000 per year. However, they reduce the cost of 'unnatural deaths' and can provide extra income tax (as long as there are places for the people to work).&lt;/p&gt;
-	&lt;p style=&quot;hp&quot;&gt;After you put a health centre in, it takes three months for it to become active. They use goods. They don't, however, use jobs as such. These are taken into account when calculating the extra jobs created by the reduction in sickness of the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;
-	&lt;p style=&quot;hp&quot;&gt;Health centres do not need to be connected to transport. If not, they need to be within range of a market.&lt;/p&gt;
